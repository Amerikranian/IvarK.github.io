# IvarK.github.io
The goal of this project is to add accessibility to the game Antimatter Dimentions. The github pages site, found [here](https://amerikranian.github.io/IvarK.github.io/), was not created to steal the work of the original developer, but rather to provide greater access to blind users until pull requests are approved.
